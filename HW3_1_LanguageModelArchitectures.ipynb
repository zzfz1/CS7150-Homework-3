You can also assume that an AxB matrix and a BxC matrix take 2ABC FLOPs to be multiplied together (about half of those are scalar multiplications and half are scalar additions). Don't worry about the final projection to the vocabulary dimension.  Even though we implemented a single layer, in the general case the model could implement L layers per step.)\n",

Each of these is a ____ by ____ matrix multiplication which comes to ______ FLOPS.  We also need to propagate the gradients with respect to the input (to train the embedding), which adds _____ FLOPS for a single token, and and hidden states (to backpropgate through time) which is _____ FLOPS per token.

    "# Understanding GRU Behavior By Interactive Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The GRU demonstration above is set up to show how a GRU can selectively update, preserve, or modify information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used a simplified two-dimenstional hidden state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we have set up the weight matrices, the data dimension (index 0) carries the actual values we want to process, while the control dimension (index 1) determines how the gates behave.  For the first exercises, we will leave the Input x[1] (Control) to be a high value, 2.0. Then you will experiment with altering the weights, to see how they affect the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Understanding Default Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The default settings (New Content Weights = 3.0) are configured to make the hidden state contain an attenuated sum of the input and the previous hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. Move the \"Input x[0] (Data)\" slider. Does the (a) new content and (b) final output wiggle in the same direction, opposite direction, or not at all?\n",
    "> YOUR ANSWER: When the input varies, the new content wiggles ...  The final output wiggles....\n",
    "2. Move the \"Hidden x[0] (Data)\" slider. Does the new content and final output respond similarly?\n",
    "> YOUR ANSWER: When the hidden state varies, the new content wiggles ...  The final output wiggles....\n",
    "3. Set both input and hidden state data values high (e.g., 2.0). What happens to the output - is it high, low, or zero?\n",
    "> YOUR ANSWER: When both input and hidden state are high, the new content is....  The final output is....  Due to the attenuation, the maximum range of the new content is .....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Computing Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Modify the \"New Content\" weights (W_xn[0,0] and W_hn[0,0]) to make the GRU compute the attenuated difference between input and hidden state, rather than their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- The new content should wiggle in the opposite direction of the hidden state\n",
    "- When both input and hidden state data are high, the new content should be close to zero\n",
    "- The final output should reflect this difference computation\n",

    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Perfect Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Find settings of the weights that cause the GRU to (almost) completely ignore the new content and instead copy the old hidden state to the new hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. What weight settings achieve this?\n",
    "> YOUR ANSWER: For perfect memory, use the weight settings....\n",
    "2. Which gate is primarily responsible for this behavior?\n",

    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4: Pure Input Mode\n",

    "**Task:** Find settings of the weights that make the GRU (almost) completely ignore the old hidden state and only use the new input, when computing the new content.\n",

    "## Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape checking**: The most common issues arise from incorrect tensor shapes. Key shapes:\n",
    "   - Input idx: (batch_size, seq_len)\n",
    "   - Embeddings: (batch_size, seq_len, n_embd)\n",
    "   - Attention: (batch_size, n_heads, seq_len, head_size)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Causal masking**: The causal mask ensures tokens can only attend to previous positions:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Mask shape: (1, 1, seq_len, seq_len)\n",
    "   mask = torch.tril(torch.ones(block_size, block_size))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-head attention**: Remember to:\n",
    "   - Split attention heads: `view(B, T, n_head, head_size)`\n",
    "   - Transpose for matrix multiplication: `transpose(1, 2)`\n",
    "   - Combine heads at end: `view(B, T, n_embd)`"
